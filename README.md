# üèö `rusty-home`

This is a self-educational pet project.

I'm attempting to make a set highly-available microservices that I could deploy onto 3x of mine [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). Each microservice is going to focus on a particular task. The microservices would exchange messages with each other through [Redis streams](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/).

## Design

Each host is running a `redis-server` and [`redis-sentinel`](https://redis.io/docs/manual/sentinel/) with enabled persistence and automatic failovers.

Each host is running a set of microservices ‚Äì ideally, all of them ‚Äì via `systemd`. The microservices should use [Redis consumer groups](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/#consumer-groups) to ensure reliable processing of messages.

- HTTP security and fault-tolerance is done by [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/tunnel/)
- Errors and performance are monitored by [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- Liveness is monitored by [Better Uptime](https://betteruptime.com/), see also the ¬´Heartbeat¬ª sections in the `README`s
- Logs are handled by `journald` and collected to [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/)
- Configuration is synced by [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
- Builds are [automated](.github/workflows/publish.yaml) with GitHub Actions and [`cross`](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross), and get deployed to the hosts via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)

Everything's using a free tier. üòâ

## Available microservices

- [x] [Tractive](rusty-tractive)
- [x] [Tractive Telegram Bot](rusty-tractive-telegram-bot)
- [ ] [tado¬∞](rusty-tado)

## Installation

For Raspberry Zero W you can grab the binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/eigenein/rusty-home/releases).

Otherwise, build them with `cargo`:

```shell
# Choose which binaries you'd like to install.
cargo install --git https://github.com/eigenein/rusty-home.git --locked rusty-tractive rusty-tractive-telegram-bot rusty-tado
```

## Motivation

I'd be happy to automate some routines, but I wouldn't like to maintain a Home Assistant instance.

I have already maintained a similar project ‚Äì [`eigenein/my-iot-rs`](https://github.com/eigenein/my-iot-rs) ‚Äì which was monolithic. But it was quite time-consuming to maintain all the internal interfaces, yet to rebuild the entire binary after a minor change. Also, the only way to extend it was to modify the monolithic source code. In theory, the new design should allow extending it using any other stack ‚Äì as soon as it's capable of reading and writing Redis streams.
