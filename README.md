# üèö `rusty-home`

This is a self-educational pet project.

I'm attempting to make a set highly-available microservices that I could deploy onto 3x of mine Raspberry Pi Zero W. Each microservice is going ot focus on a particular task. The microservices would exchange messages with each other through [Redis streams](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/).

## Motivation

I'd be happy to automate some routines, but I wouldn't like to maintain a Home Assistant instance.

I have already maintained a similar project ‚Äì [`eigenein/my-iot-rs`](https://github.com/eigenein/my-iot-rs) ‚Äì which was monolithic. But it was quite time-consuming to maintain all the internal interfaces, yet to rebuild the entire binary after a minor change. Also, the only way to extend it was to modify the monolithic source code. In theory, the new design should allow extending it using any other stack ‚Äì as soon as it's capable of reading and writing Redis streams.

## Design

Each host is running a `redis-server` and [`redis-sentinel`](https://redis.io/docs/manual/sentinel/) with enabled persistence and automatic failovers.

Each host is running a set of microservices ‚Äì ideally, all of them ‚Äì via `systemd`. The microservices should use [Redis consumer groups](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/#consumer-groups) to ensure reliable processing of messages.

The microservices are monitored via Sentry and `journald`.

## Microservices

- [tado¬∞](rusty-tado)
- [Tractive](rusty-tractive)

## Installation

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/eigenein/rusty-home.git --locked rusty-tractive rusty-tado
```

I suggest that you have at least 1 GB of RAM or swap space in order to compile it from source. On Raspberry Pi Zero W setting `CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024` in `/etc/dphys-swapfile` seems to work fine.
